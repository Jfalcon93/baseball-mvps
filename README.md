# Baseball-MVPs

Small app created out of spite lol. The mlb denied api access to me (unjust!). All I wanted to do was make a hee hee ha ha joke app about shohei ohtani cause a friend in my life thinks they're sooo smart. Mr. baseball anaylist himself thinks that shohei is having a goat season (which he is admittedly). It was gonna be a spa that updated daily based on previous nights performance to say whether he was having a 🐐 season or a 💩 season (no in between).

Initially I tried scraping shohei's baseball reference page but there's chunks of commented code that was screwing up any web crawl (like WHY??).

Current app shows all the mlb mvp's data contained on their page. Search by year to see NL and AL MVPS and maybe, if we're lucky, somebody with great UI/UX experience will have a better idea on how to display this data.
